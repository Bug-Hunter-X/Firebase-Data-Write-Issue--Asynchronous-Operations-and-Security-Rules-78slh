In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't being written to the database despite seemingly correct code. The issue stemmed from an incorrect understanding of how Firebase's asynchronous nature interacts with data persistence.  The `set()` method, for example, returns a promise, and changes weren't reflected until the promise resolved.  I also found that improperly configured security rules could silently block writes.
